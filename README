workflow is as follows:

data must be created in the Illustris1, sersic_blobs, TNG_cutouts and Empty_fields folders. The data folder also contains the script to create SDSS data (to be fixed for consistency). 

The source code for PixelCNN is in ./src

The processing (forward pass through the networks) is in ./processing . 
The dataframes for the processing can be retrieved from get_dataframes_LLR.py in this folder.

After running the processing it is necessary to run 
./analysis/likelihood_distribs.py to get the likelihood distributions.
