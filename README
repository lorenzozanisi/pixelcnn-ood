workflow is as follows:

data must be created in the Illustris1, sersic_blobs, TNG_cutouts and Empty_fields folders. The data folder also contains the script to create SDSS data (to be fixed for consistency). 

The source code for PixelCNN is in ./src

The processing (forward pass through the networks) is in ./processing

After running the processing it is necessary to run 
./analysis/likelihood_distribs.py to get the likelihood distributions. This file also creates the DataFrames (stored in ./data/DataFrames_LLR/) necessary to run the notebook ./analysis/get_maps.ipynb, which creates maps of the quantities of interest for the various models.
